## 🧠 How It Works

1. Waits for the full HTML to load using `DOMContentLoaded`.
2. Lets users type tasks into an input field.
3. On clicking the **Add Task** button or pressing **Enter**, a new task is added to the list.
4. Each task has a **Remove** button to delete it from the list.
5. Input field clears after each task is added.
